    <section>  
      <p>Let’s see a quick example of how not taking in count the topics treated on this style guide can get us in trouble in our jobs.</p>
      
      <h4>Team scenario</h4>

      <p>Dany and Jesus work at a startup that created a web app, both of them write code in the front-end of the app. They have different approaches when writing HTML/CSS (different ways of naming, different ways or organizing things, etc.) In one occasion, Dany needed to set some styles to and HTML element, so he wrote this class:</p>

      <pre>
      // Dani's code
      .button-big-blue {
        padding: 30px;
        font-size: 20px;
        background-color: blue;
        border:2px solid black;
      } </pre>

      <p>And he added the class to the end of one style-sheet file where all the apps styles lie. Sometime after, Jesus needed to add a style to another button, one that is red. So he wrote this class:</p>

      <pre>
      // Jesus's code
      .hightlight-smallButton {
        font-size: 10px;
        background-color: red;
        padding: 10px;
        border-radius: 5px;
      } </pre>

      <p>Now, imagine that a new front-end developer joins the team, and he has to get familiarized with the app's code. He starts by looking the end of the style-sheet file, where he finds these two classes. Don't you feel mercy for him/her?</p>
      
      <p>And the problem is not only for others developers reading Dany/Jesus code, even they have huge issues while working together. It takes them more time to understand what their partner’s code do. Sometimes they have to ask the author, and sometimes they are in such a hurry that they might decide to do what they need to do even in questionable way.</p>

      <p>Here are more classes:</p>

      <pre>
      &lt;button class=&quot;button-big-blue&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;<br/>      &lt;button class=&quot;hightlight-smallButton&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;<br/>      // And even more buttons (and even more developers writing code)<br/>      &lt;button class=&quot;githubBtn&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;<br/>      &lt;button class=&quot;get-user-atention  tomorrow&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt;<br/>      &lt;button class=&quot;btn  that-btn&quot;&gt;&lt;/button&gt; </pre>

      <p>Many issues can be found in this simple scenario. We can see how:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It’s hard to change something in the HTML/CSS of the app. Because you cannot have a clear idea of why something is somewhere, and what it does, you don’t know what you can break if you change something related to it.</li>
        <li>Standards are hard to follow. Elements may look and behave in different ways (e.g.: two different blue buttons that should look the same).</li>
        <li>Because there isn’t an organized way doing things, it’s hard to find where something is (and duplications occur too).</li>
        <li>It’s hard to reuse something because they are many random dependencies that you don’t know (duplications happen again).</li>
        <li>And many more</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now, multiply this example by a large number of lines of code, adds different languages and add more developer to the equation, and you will have a really inefficient environment with a lot of messy code that is hard, slow and expensive to maintain.</p>

      <h4>Its only you</h4>

      <p>Don’t think that because you work alone you won’t experience similar scenarios. One of the reasons I found BEM it was because I desperately needed a standard way of writing HTML/CSS. While working, I even didn’t want to come back to my old code, because even if it was only me, like I didn’t have a standard methodology; similar scenarios as the Dany/Jesus one will were happening to me.</p>

      <p>If you are working in some small project that won’t change soon (like a small company website), that you won't be in charge of maintaining it, usually you don’t have big issues after working without an organized and standardized methodology. The code just need to works, that’s it. Maybe some other person will have difficulty working with you code, but you won’t even know it. But you know that person will think “I hate reading other people’s code” in the same way you maybe had think this.</p>

      <p>But when you are in a project where changes happen frequently, you know how hard is to do things in a Dany/Jesus scenario.</p>

      <h4>Conclution</h4>
      <p>If you are like me, maybe you are more interested in learning that cool javascript library instead of studying that boring HTML/CSS, but my advice to you is that if you are a front-end developer and you are not yet familiar with the concepts explained in this style-guide, find yourself some time and do it. Your work after doing it will be a lot more easy and enjoyable. </p>
